When people are traveling, they are usually using their cell phones or one of its features. 
Unfortunately, they are often left disappointed because many areas are dead zones.
  Phone service availability is vital, so they will always check their phones for service.
  Our project, the Phone Service Alert Application, will focus on eliminating this issue by notifying 
  users when they enter areas with service. The application will be integrated with detailed coverage 
  maps from service providers, allowing the users to view the coverage data based on their location. 
  Our application will ensure that our users will not have to check their phones fanatically for 
  service availability. Users will also have the options to customize their notifications and alerts. 
  Our product will bring our users peace of mind, knowing that their phones will notify them when 
  service will be available again.
